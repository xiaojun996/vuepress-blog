### [Describes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

Given two strings <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">text1</span> and <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">text2</span>, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">"ace"</span> is a subsequence of <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">"abcde"</span>.

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000</span>
- <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">text1</span> and <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">text2</span> consist of only lowercase English characters.

### DP

:::: tabs type:board-card

::: tab JavaScript 版 lazy

```JavaScript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1: string, text2: string): number {
  const len1 = text1.length
  const len2 = text2.length
  const DP = new Array(len1 + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(len2 + 1).fill(0))

  for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i += 1) {
    const char1 = text1[i]

    for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j += 1) {
      const char2 = text2[j]

      if (char1 === char2) DP[i][j] = DP[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
      else DP[i][j] = Math.max(DP[i - 1][j], DP[i][j - 1])
    }
  }

  return DP[len1][len2]
}
```
