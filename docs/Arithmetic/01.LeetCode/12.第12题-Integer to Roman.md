### [Describes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: <span class="span-shadow">I</span>, <span class="span-shadow">V</span>, <span class="span-shadow">X</span>, <span class="span-shadow">L</span>, <span class="span-shadow">C</span>, <span class="span-shadow">D</span> and <span class="span-shadow">M</span>.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, <span class="span-shadow">2</span> is written as <span class="span-shadow">II</span> in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. <span class="span-shadow">12</span> is written as <span class="span-shadow">XII</span>, which is simply <span class="span-shadow">X + II</span>. The number <span class="span-shadow">27</span> is written as <span class="span-shadow">XXVII</span>, which is <span class="span-shadow">XX + V + II</span>.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not <span class="span-shadow">IIII</span>. Instead, the number four is written as <span class="span-shadow">IV</span>. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as <span class="span-shadow">IX</span>. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- <span class="span-shadow">I</span> can be placed before <span class="span-shadow">V</span> (5) and <span class="span-shadow">X</span> (10) to make 4 and 9.
- <span class="span-shadow">X</span> can be placed before <span class="span-shadow">L</span> (50) and <span class="span-shadow">C</span> (100) to make 40 and 90.
- <span class="span-shadow">C</span> can be placed before <span class="span-shadow">D</span> (500) and <span class="span-shadow">M</span> (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 4
Output: "IV"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = 9
Output: "IX"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- <span class="span-shadow">1 <= num <= 3999</span>

::: tab TypeScript

```TypeScript
function intToRoman(num: number): string {
  let dummyNum = num

  const valueSymbols: [number, string][] = [
    [1000, 'M'],
    [900, 'CM'],
    [500, 'D'],
    [400, 'CD'],
    [100, 'C'],
    [90, 'XC'],
    [50, 'L'],
    [40, 'XL'],
    [10, 'X'],
    [9, 'IX'],
    [5, 'V'],
    [4, 'IV'],
    [1, 'I'],
  ]

  const roman = []

  for (const [value, sym] of valueSymbols) {
    while (dummyNum >= value) {
      dummyNum -= value
      roman.push(sym)
    }
    if (dummyNum === 0) break
  }

  return roman.join('')
}
```
