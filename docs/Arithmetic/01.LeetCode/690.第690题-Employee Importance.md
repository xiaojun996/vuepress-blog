### [Describes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/employee-importance/)

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, their **importance value** and their **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, <span class="span-shadow">employee 1</span> is the leader of <span class="span-shadow">employee 2</span>, and <span class="span-shadow">employee 2</span> is the leader of <span class="span-shadow">employee 3</span>. They have **importance value** <span class="span-shadow">15, 10 and 5</span>, respectively. Then <span class="span-shadow">employee 1</span> has a data structure like <span class="span-shadow">[1, 15, [2]]</span>, and <span class="span-shadow">employee 2</span> has <span class="span-shadow">[2, 10, [3]]</span>, and <span class="span-shadow">employee 3</span> has <span class="span-shadow">[3, 5, []]</span>. Note that although <span class="span-shadow">employee 3</span> is also a subordinate of <span class="span-shadow">employee 1</span>, the relationship is **not direct**.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total **importance value** of this employee and all their subordinates.

<!-- more -->

**Example:**

```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

**Note:**

- One employee has at most one **direct** leader and may have several subordinates.
- The maximum number of employees won't exceed <span class="span-shadow">2000</span>.

### 解题思路

- 转化成 hashMap 后再 DFS

### DFS

:::: tabs

::: tab TypeScript

```TypeScript
declare type UserInfo = {
  importance: number
  subordinates: number[]
}

function GetImportance(employees: Employee[], id: number): number {
  const hashMap: Map<number, UserInfo> = new Map()
  employees.forEach(({ id, importance, subordinates }) => hashMap.set(id, { importance, subordinates }))

  let ans = 0

  const dfs = (id: number): void => {
    if (!hashMap.has(id)) return

    const { importance, subordinates } = hashMap.get(id)

    ans += importance

    for (const sub of subordinates) dfs(sub)
  }

  dfs(id)

  return ans
}
```
