### [Describes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest/)

In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some subset of rabbits (possibly all of them) tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">answers</span> are placed in an array.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

<!-- more -->

**Example:**

```
Input: answers = [1, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit than answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.

Input: answers = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 11

Input: answers = []
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">answers</span> will have length at most <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">1000</span>.
- Each <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">answers[i]</span> will be an integer in the range <span style="background: #ddd; color: #666;">[0, 999]</span>.

### 解题思路

- 当某个 🐰 回答还有和自己同色 🐰 数有 n 的时候，那么数组中最多允许 n + 1 个同花色的 🐰 同时回答 n

### 贪心法

:::: tabs type:board-card

::: tab JavaScript 版 lazy

```JavaScript
function numRabbits(answers) {
  const hashMap = new Map()
  let count = 0

  for (const answer of answers) {
    if (hashMap.has(answer) && hashMap.get(answer) > 0) {
      // 同色 - 1
      hashMap.set(answer, hashMap.get(answer) - 1);
    } else {
      count += answer + 1
      hashMap.set(answer, answer)
    }
  }

  return count
}
```

  for (const answer of answers) {
    if (hashMap.has(answer) && hashMap.get(answer) > 0) {
      // 同色 - 1
      hashMap.set(answer, hashMap.get(answer) - 1);
