### [Describes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within <span class="span-shadow">D</span> days.

The i<sup>th</sup> package on the conveyor belt has a weight of <span class="span-shadow">D</span><span class="span-shadow">weights[i]</span>. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by <span class="span-shadow">D</span><span class="span-shadow">weights</span>). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within <span class="span-shadow">D</span> days.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
```

**Constraints:**

- <span class="span-shadow">1 <= D <= weights.length <= 5 \* 10<sup>4</sup></span>
- <span class="span-shadow">1 <= weights[i] <= 500</span>

### 解题思路

- 最低运载能力就是 最大包裹重量
- 最高运载能力就是 包裹总数
- 使用二分查找，查找 **最大包裹重量 < mid < 包裹总数** 的 **mid**

### 二分查找

:::: tabs type:board-card

::: tab TypeScript 版 lazy

```TypeScript
function shipWithinDays(weights: number[], D: number): number {
  let max = 0
  let sum = 0
  for (const w of weights) {
    max = Math.max(max, w)
    sum += w
  }

  let left = max
  let right = sum

  while (left < right) {
    // 二分找 mid
    const mid = (left + right) >> 1

    // 检查 是否满足 D 天内能送达所有包裹
    if (check(weights, mid, D)) {
      right = mid
    } else {
      left = mid + 1
    }
  }

  return right
}

function check(weights: number[], mid: number, D: number): boolean {
  const len = weights.length
  let day = 0
  let sum = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < len; ) {
    while (i < len && sum + weights[i] <= mid) {
      // 每天载荷
      sum = sum + weights[i]
      i++
    }

    // 天数 + 1 清空货车
    sum = 0
    day++
  }

  // 检查 是否满足 D 天内能送达所有包裹
  return day <= D
}
```
