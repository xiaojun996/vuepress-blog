### [Describes](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have <span class="span-shadow">n</span> versions <span class="span-shadow">[1, 2, ..., n]</span> and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API <span class="span-shadow">bool isBadVersion(version)</span> which returns whether <span class="span-shadow">version</span> is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- <span class="span-shadow">1 <= bad <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</span>

### 解题思路

- 使用二分查找，每判断一次都可以缩紧一次边界，而每次缩紧时两边界距离将变为原来的一半。

### 二分查找

```TypeScript
 /**
 * The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
 * isBadVersion(version: number): boolean {
 *     ...
 * };
 */

const solution = (isBadVersion: any) => {
  return (n: number): number => {
    let left = 1
    let right = n
    let mid = 0

    while (left < right) {
      mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2)

      if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
        right = mid
      } else {
        left = mid + 1
      }
    }

    return right
  }
}
```
